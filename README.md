Numerical and analytical model used for building a Hexastorm.
The analytical model is contained in analytical.py
The numerical model is contained in simulation.py.
The article where the model and the technology for the Hexastorm is outlined is available here;

The Zemax lens is contained in zmax_49332ink.zmx.
Installation info for Rayopt is available here https://github.com/jordens/rayopt.
Note that the glass and stock catalogs need to be grabbed from the Windows installation to parse the lens data. The program also works under Linux.
